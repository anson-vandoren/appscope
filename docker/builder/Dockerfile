# Cribl AppScopeâ„¢ - Build under Docker
#
# by Paul Dugas <paul@dugas.cc>
#

# ---
# Use the Ubuntu 18.04 image by default. Override this like below.
#
#     docker build --build-arg IMAGE=ubuntu:latest ...
#
ARG IMAGE=ubuntu:18.04
FROM $IMAGE

# ---
# Use the current version of Go in the longsleep/golang-backports PPA by
# default. Override this like below.
#
#     docker build --build-arg GOLANG=golang-1.16 ...
#
ARG GOLANG=golang
ENV GOLANG=$GOLANG

# ---
# Install packages. Note extra PPA for Go.
#
# Also note that this logic duplicates the top-level `install_build_tools.sh`
# script. Trying to use that script here causes issues because of its use of
# `sudu` when running the package installer. It clears the environment so the
# additions above don't apply and we end up with interaction when some of the
# dependencies (i.e. tzdata) are installed.
#
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND="noninteractive"
ENV TZ="America/New_York"
